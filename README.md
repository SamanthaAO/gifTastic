# gifTastic

This game uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap.

When you click one of the stock cartoon buttons gifs from the cartoon displayed on the button will be shown. If you click on the gif images they will animate, click again to freeze them. If you wish to view more gifs on this same cartoon click the load more gifs button at the bottom of the page. If you like the gif that you see click the favorite button to have it saved to your favorites page(this page is stored locally). At this point the favorites button wil also disapear because you cannot favorite a gif twice. To view your favorites page click on the view favorites page button next to the create button underneath the input. If you would like to see gifs from other cartoons or other subject matters you can enter these into the input and create a button. The button will be added to the button area and when the button is clicked then gifs based on that term will be displayed.
